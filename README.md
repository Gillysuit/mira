MiraCloud is a desktop app that offers an AWS user a chance to visualize all of their services in a specific region or in all of them at once. The user-friendly interface allows the user to <b>launch</b>, <b>delete</b>, <b>run</b> and <b>stop</b> an instance of services like EC2, RDS and S3 buckets. It also <b>creates and deletes connections between security groups</b> of those instances. 

## Getting Started
- [ ] Clone the repo.
`git clone *github url` or use SSH 
- [ ] Go to directory and run `npm install` to install all the dependencies
- [ ] Run `npm run build` to bundle your Electron application
- [ ] Run `npm start` to start MiraCloud

## Login
The login interface securely handles the user's IAM keys by saving into a hidden folder and deleting it upon logout.
1. Set up a new IAM user on your AWS console: Make sure you keep your aws_access_key_id and aws_secret_access_key by downloading the .csv file
2. Give permissions to AWS IAM User. 
	For read, write, and delete, give permission by:

		AmazonEC2FullAccess
		AmazonRDSFullAccess
		AmazonS3FullAccess
		AWSLambdaFullAccess

	For viewing only, give permissions by:

		AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess
		AmazonRDSReadOnlyAccess
		AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess
		AWSLambdaReadOnlyAccess


	The user will use their public and secret key generated by creating a new IAM user on their AWS account. Once signed in,  if the keys are real, the user will choose rather they want to see their instances in one or in all regions.

## Choosing a region
The user will be able to see all instances of EC2, RDS, S3 and lambdas functions they might have. In a specific region, it runs the SDKs specific to each instance and build up an object per VPC per region to generate graphic nodes through cytoscape. In all regions, the app runs a GraphQl query to filter only the relevant data.

## Node Details
Once a node is clicked, the user can see  will allow the user to see the data on the instance selected

## Configure security groups
Editing security groups through AWS is unclear for many users that do not regularly use the AWS dashboard. With the navigatable UI provided by Mira, the user can click on a particular instance to get all data associated with it. In addition to viewing this data, inbound and outbound rules for security groups can be effortlessly changed and these changes will be immediately seen by the user.
